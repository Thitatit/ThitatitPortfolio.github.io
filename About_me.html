								<p>Mechanical engineering student who is particularly interested in data analysis and the use of statistical models to make predictions. I am willing to learn, relearn skills, and possess strong self-learning abilities. I have learned how to prepare, clean, and utilise statistical learning to predict and describe data. I had worked as a data scientist in Bangkok bank for three months before I went to study English overseas in Australia while supporting myself by doing a part-time job for seven months. I enjoyed learning new things and making new friends</p>
